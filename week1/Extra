#What’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

#ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  #geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))

#Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run mpg?

#Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

#What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?

#Take the first faceted plot in this section:

#ggplot(data = mpg) + 
#  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
#  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
#What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?
