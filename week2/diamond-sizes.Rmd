We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```
<!-- 27.3.1 Q3--> 

Striking features is the peak at 0.30 carat showing more than 25,000 diamonds. 
Majority of diamonds are at 0.30 and 1.1 carats.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, color = cut, fill = cut)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, color = color, fill = color)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, color = clarity, fill = clarity)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```
