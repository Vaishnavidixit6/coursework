# We write alive on 27 cards representing patients who were alive at
# the end of the study, and dead on 75 cards representing patients
# who were not. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups:
# one group of size 69 representing treatment, and another group of
# size 34 representing control. We calculate the difference between
# the proportion of dead cards in the treatment and control groups (treatment -
# control) and record this value. We repeat this many times to build a distribution
# centered at p_C - p_T = 0. Lastly, we calculate the fraction of simulations where
# the simulated differences in proportions are p_C - p_T greater than 0. If this fraction is low,
# we conclude that it is unlikely to have observed such an outcome by chance and
# that the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative.

# (a) The distribution of the sample proportions of vegetarians in random samples of size 60 is
# approximately normal since n â‰¥ 30. 
# False because, n>=30,  np>=10 which in this case is 4.8 !>=10, n(1-p) >=10
# (b) The distribution of the sample proportions of vegetarian college students in random samples
# of size 50 is right skewed.
# 
# (c) A random sample of 125 college students where 12% are vegetarians would be considered
# unusual.
# 
# (d) A random sample of 250 college students where 12% are vegetarians would be considered

# 
# (e) The standard error would be reduced by one-half if we increased the sample size from 125
# to 250.
